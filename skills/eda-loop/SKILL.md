name: eda-loop
description: "Orchestrates a single scoped EDA task end-to-end for VLSI design workflows. Runs bootstrap checks (knowledge gate, tool catalog, infrastructure guard), routes to the minimal set of specialist skills (placement, routing, timing, power optimization), executes under hard validation gates (PDK preflight, execution-contract checks, comparison-policy enforcement), and produces verified closeout artifacts with full execution evidence. Use when you need to run a governed EDA experiment, submit a route/CTS batch with preflight validation, test an algorithmic hypothesis against baselines, or execute any VLSI design task that requires auditable artifact trails and gate-controlled quality assurance."

# EDA Loop

## Role Boundary

`eda-loop` is the execution orchestrator for a scoped task.
Global entry, cross-task governance, and recursion policy belong to `AGENTS.md` (repo root).

Use this skill when you need disciplined execution with explicit artifacts.

## Inputs

Provide or derive:
1. scoped objective,
2. target design/config set,
3. required output artifacts,
4. comparison-policy lock (if claim/comparison is requested).

## Step 1: Bootstrap gates

1. Enter repo root and ensure task brief exists.
2. Run gate before substantive actions:

```bash
bash scripts/common/knowledge_gate.sh --scope <scope_name> --task-brief <task_brief_md>
```

3. Query tool catalog before adding scripts:

```bash
python3 scripts/common/tool_catalog.py query <keyword1> <keyword2>
```

4. Enforce tri-source evidence before non-trivial conclusions:
   - local logs/data,
   - local KB history,
   - internet/primary-source evidence when assumptions are unstable.
5. For infrastructure maintain/develop tasks, run stack guard:

```bash
python3 scripts/common/infra_stack_guard.py --out-prefix slurm_logs/00_meta/infra_stack_guard_<tag>
```

## Step 2: Skill routing (minimal set)

Select the smallest set of specialist skills that covers the scoped objective.
Consult `references/skill-routing.md` for the full routing matrix (24 request patterns mapped to skills and scripts).

Key routing shortcuts:
- **Full research chain**: use `eda-research-chain` as the primary workflow skill.
- **Goal-driven optimization** (power/frequency targets): use `bspdn-goal-driver`.
- **Pre-experiment reflection**: use `eda-preflight-reflect` before any new submission.
- **Post-experiment retrospective**: use `eda-retro` to classify failures and decide recursion.
- **Skill creation/installation**: use `skill-creator` or `skill-installer`.

## Step 3: Execute under hard gates
1. Announce selected skills and first action.
2. Execute fully (do not stop at plan-only unless asked).
3. For any new experiment submission/comparison request, run `eda-preflight-reflect` first and produce a reflection artifact before launching jobs.
4. For route/CTS submissions, run unified PDK/flow preflight (`scripts/debug/pdk_flow_preflight.py`) and block submission on FAIL.
5. Keep artifact paths explicit (`monitor.md`, `summary.md`, `manifest.tsv`, etc.).
6. After batch completion, run execution-contract validation (`scripts/debug/validate_execution_contract.py`) and mark FAIL rows as non-promotable evidence.
7. Ingest manifest rows into experiment memory (`scripts/common/experiment_memory.py`) and produce constrained follow-up candidates (`scripts/debug/propose_constrained_experiments.py`) when optimization continues.
8. If a gate fails, fix cause before proceeding.
9. Comparison policy lock:
- For algorithmic claims, enforce primary baseline as `vanilla_replace`.
- If Innovus is used, keep it as secondary realizability validation only.
- If only Innovus baseline exists, mark algorithmic conclusion as invalid and stop promotion.

## Step 4: Closeout artifacts

1. Update maintenance log (`slurm_logs/00_meta/knowledge_tool_maintenance_log.md`) for substantive changes.
2. If a skill is modified in this interaction, validate it:

```bash
python3 /home/grads/d/donghao/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py <skill_path>
```

3. Append hypothesis-validation-conclusion entry when a hypothesis was tested:
   - `docs/knowledge_base/90_HYPOTHESIS_VALIDATION_LOG.md`
4. For infrastructure maintain/develop tasks, include both artifacts:
   - `infra_stack_guard` summary
   - `skill_system_audit` summary

## Hard-stop conditions
Do not close task if any condition is true:
1. No maintenance-log update for this interaction.
2. No tool-catalog query evidence for non-trivial changes.
3. Artifacts created but not linked in final summary.
4. Skill modified but not validated.
5. Algorithmic claim made without `vanilla_replace` primary baseline.
6. Route/CTS batch referenced without unified preflight artifact.
7. Route-level conclusion given while execution-contract artifact contains unresolved FAIL rows.

## Out of scope for this skill

1. Defining global entry policy.
2. Defining recursion policy across interactions.
3. Declaring global self-update policy for the whole skill system.
