# Academic Presentation Crafter

## Overview

This skill provides a structured, multi-phase workflow for transforming dense research papers into clear, concise, and academically rigorous presentations. It ensures the final slide deck accurately reflects the paper's core contributions, data, and terminology.

## Workflow

The process is divided into four distinct phases. Follow these steps sequentially to ensure a high-quality outcome. For detailed checklists on rigor and visual polish, refer to the `references/` directory.

## External Advisor Mode (Required for committee/group reports)

When the audience is external (advisor, committee, collaborator), enforce:
1. English-only slide text.
2. No local machine/repo disclosure:
   - remove absolute paths,
   - remove local usernames/hostnames,
   - replace run IDs/version-like suffixes with semantic labels (e.g., `Baseline`, `Variant-B`).
3. Prefer neutral artifact naming in slides (`Case-A`, `Case-B`) and move raw identifiers to private appendix only if requested.
4. If slide tooling allows, produce `beamer` (`.tex`) and compile to `.pdf`; otherwise keep a clean Markdown deck as fallback.

Action: follow `references/external_reporting_sanitization_checklist.md` before finalizing.

### Phase 1: Foundational Analysis & Outline Generation

The goal of this phase is to deeply understand the source material and create a logical structure for the presentation.

1.  **Initial Skim & Core Contribution Identification**: Read the paper's abstract, introduction, and conclusion to grasp the main argument, key contributions, and overall narrative.
2.  **Identify Key Figures & Data**: Scan the paper for essential figures, charts, tables, and equations that are critical for explaining the methodology and results. Note their figure numbers and captions.
3.  **Generate a Comprehensive Outline**: Create a slide outline. If slide tooling is unavailable, generate a Markdown deck (`.md`) with `---` page separators. A typical academic structure is recommended (Motivation, Methods, Results, Conclusion). Start with 8-12 slides and expand only if necessary.

### Phase 2: Content Drafting & Asset Integration

This phase focuses on populating the slides with content and integrating the necessary visual aids.

1.  **Draft Slide Content**: Write the content for each slide. Paraphrase the paper's content into concise bullet points and short sentences.
2.  **Integrate Visuals**: Incorporate the key figures and diagrams identified in Phase 1. Ensure images are high-resolution and placed logically.
3.  **Data Placeholders**: For slides that will contain charts or graphs, clearly note the data source from the paper. Do not invent or approximate data.

### Phase 3: Academic Rigor & Content Refinement

This phase ensures the presentation meets academic standards. Apply the full checklist in `references/academic_rigor_checklist.md`, paying special attention to these critical items:

1. **Data and Metrics Verification**: Cross-check every number, table entry, and graph value against the source paper. Flag any discrepancy before proceeding.
2. **Terminology and Acronyms**: Define all acronyms on first use. Ensure domain-specific terms (e.g., PPA, timing closure, netlist) match the paper's definitions exactly.
3. **Claims and Contributions**: Verify that no slide overstates or understates the paper's claims. Each contribution slide must trace back to a specific section of the paper.
4. **Citations**: Include inline citations for all borrowed figures, data, and direct quotes. Use the paper's citation style consistently.

**Feedback loop**: After applying the checklist, revisit Phase 2 slides — update any content that was corrected here and re-verify data placeholders.

### Phase 4: Visual Polish & Final Review

Apply the full checklist in `references/visual_polish_checklist.md`, focusing on these high-impact items:

1. **Typography**: Minimum 18pt body font, 24pt+ for slide titles. Ensure consistent font family across all slides.
2. **Layout consistency**: Uniform margins, bullet indentation, and figure placement. Align elements to a grid.
3. **Visual cohesion**: Use a single color palette derived from the institution or conference theme. Limit accent colors to 2-3.

**Feedback loop**: Do a full sequential walkthrough of the deck. If any slide feels unclear or visually inconsistent, return to the relevant earlier phase to fix the root cause before finalizing.

## Example Output

A results slide in Markdown format:

```markdown
## Results: Timing Closure Improvement

- Proposed flow achieves **12% WNS reduction** vs. baseline (Table 3)
- Area overhead: +2.1% (within PPA budget)
- Runtime: 3.2× faster than conventional approach

> Speaker notes: Emphasize the WNS improvement first, then address
> the area-runtime tradeoff. Reference Table 3 for detailed breakdowns.
