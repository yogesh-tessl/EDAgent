name: eda-research-chain
description: "Orchestrates a full Electronic Design Automation (EDA) research chain across eleven stages — knowledge-gap mapping, literature retrieval and PDF summarization, idea brainstorming and debate, hypothesis-to-experiment design with preflight checks, method implementation, git-based multi-version development, validation via delay-model gate evaluation, retrospective analysis, and milestone summary generation. Produces auditable artifacts at every stage including gap maps, paper indices, pro/con debates, experiment matrices, implementation plans, version deltas, and validation summaries. Use when the user requests an end-to-end VLSI research workflow, needs to run a complete EDA research pipeline, or wants to chain knowledge exploration through validation and retrospective for a new chip-design method."

# EDA Research Chain

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks for an end-to-end research workflow, not a single isolated experiment step.

## Scope

This skill orchestrates the full chain and delegates each stage to specialized skills.
Global governance still follows `AGENTS.md`.

## Stage flow

1. Bootstrap chain workspace:

```bash
python3 scripts/common/init_research_chain.py --tag <tag>
```

2. Knowledge exploration:
- use `eda-knowledge-explorer` to map local knowledge gaps,
- produce `01_knowledge/knowledge_gap_map.md`.

3. Literature retrieval + local parsing:
- use `eda-paper-fetch` to generate download queue,
- use `eda-pdf-local-summary` after local PDFs are available,
- produce `02_literature/paper_download_queue.tsv` and `02_literature/local_paper_summary_index.md`.

4. Idea brainstorming and debate:
- use `eda-idea-debate-lab`,
- produce `03_idea_debate/idea_brainstorm.md` and `03_idea_debate/pro_con_debate.md`.

5. Hypothesis -> experiment design:
- use `eda-hypothesis-experiment-designer`,
- run `eda-preflight-reflect` before expensive submissions,
- produce `04_hypothesis_design/hypothesis_experiment_matrix.tsv`.

6. Method implementation:
- use `eda-method-implementer`,
- produce `05_implementation/implementation_plan.md`.

7. Multi-version development and integration:
- use `git-version-control`,
- produce `06_versioning/version_plan.md` and version delta notes.

8. Validation and decision:
- execute via `eda-loop`,
- use validation tools/skills (`delay-model-gate-evaluator`, execution contract),
- produce `07_validation/validation_summary.md`.

9. Retrospective:
- use `eda-retro`,
- produce `08_retro/research_retro.md`.

10. Version milestone summary slides (conditional):
- do not generate slides for every process stage by default.
- generate a PDF summary only when a new version achieves a validated milestone improvement (e.g., first reach `>=2%` power reduction with non-worse area/timing, then higher milestones).
- summary should include: method delta, key conclusion, evidence table, and next-step plan.

11. Guard completeness:

```bash
python3 scripts/common/research_chain_guard.py --chain-dir <chain_dir> --out-prefix <prefix>
```

## Example invocation

> "Run a full research chain to explore gate-sizing strategies for power reduction on the skywater130 PDK."

This triggers all eleven stages: the chain bootstraps a workspace, maps knowledge gaps around gate sizing, retrieves and summarizes relevant papers, debates candidate ideas, designs hypothesis experiments with preflight reflection, implements the chosen method, versions it in git, validates against delay-model gates, writes a retrospective, and guards completeness.

## Hard rules

1. Do not skip the hypothesis design stage before implementation.
2. Do not promote a method without explicit validation artifact.
3. Keep each stage artifact path explicit and auditable.
4. If critical guard checks fail, block chain completion.
