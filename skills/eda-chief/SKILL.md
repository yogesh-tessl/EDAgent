description: "Legacy compatibility shim for historical eda-chief, chief, or run-chief invocations. Use when old prompts, scripts, or aliases still call eda-chief or reference the chief orchestrator role, then routes through AGENTS.md governance policy and dispatches scoped execution briefs to eda-loop for iterative EDA experimentation, invoking eda-theory-veto for risk gating and eda-retro for batch retrospectives as needed."

# EDA Chief

## Role

`eda-chief` is no longer the primary orchestrator.
It is a compatibility layer for older workflows that still call this skill name.

Top-level governance is defined in `AGENTS.md` at repo root.

## What to do when invoked

1. Load `AGENTS.md` and follow its global routing/governance policy.
2. Convert legacy "chief-style" request into a scoped execution brief.
3. Dispatch execution to `eda-loop` for iterative EDA experimentation.
4. Add control skills only when needed:
   - `eda-theory-veto` for high-cost/high-risk proposals.
   - `eda-retro` after experiment batches that need next-step decision.
5. If `AGENTS.md` is missing or the request cannot be mapped to a valid execution brief, halt and report the routing failure rather than proceeding with an unscoped dispatch.
6. Keep outputs short and artifact-driven.

### Example: legacy invocation mapping

A legacy prompt such as:

```
@eda-chief run timing closure on block_aes with 10% margin
```

Maps to the following scoped execution brief dispatched to `eda-loop`:

```yaml
scope: block_aes
task: timing-closure
constraint: margin >= 10%
control: eda-theory-veto (auto-attach, cost threshold exceeded)
```

## Hard boundaries

1. Do not redefine global entry policy inside this skill.
2. Do not duplicate global recursion/self-update policy from `AGENTS.md`.
3. Prefer domain skills for domain reasoning and implementation.
4. Mention compatibility mode explicitly when this skill is used.
